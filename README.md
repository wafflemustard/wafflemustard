## Hey

it's a me

wafflemustard

### Who?
wafflemustard

i do various creative-ish things

there isn't any code here at the moment unless i forgot to update this. maybe someday there will be

you can find stuff i make on
* [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/wafflemustard) - if you like serious short fiction, absurd short fiction, or mid-tier shitposting. this is the most active, which isn't saying much right now
* [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCog_DK40avFEiB11ujM4STQ) - if you like very short, very shit videos. i don't know how to edit but i'm taking film classes so maybe one day there will be something good
* [twitter](https://twitter.com/wafflemustard) - if you like very inactive accounts that occasionally tweet links to stuff on other platforms
* [linktree](https://linktr.ee/wafflemustard) - if you want to see all of these links again in a list but this time without my dubiously helpful descriptions distracting you

that's all i got. have a pleasant day
